  "Far away across the oceans. An undiscovered paradise. Forget New York and California. There’s a better place – now close your eyes. Take my hand. We are almost there. Our favorite place on Earth." - Ylvis

I also enjoy music, play drums, and am a big time fan of the [New England Patriots][ne]. Feel free to take a look around and contact me with any questions.
